# Dockerfile
# First of all, we include where we are getting the image
# from. Image can be thought of as an operating system.
# You can do "FROM ubuntu:18.04"
# this will start from a clean ubuntu 18.04 image.
# All images are downloaded from dockerhub
# Here are we grabbing image from nvidia's repo
# they created a docker image using ubuntu 18.04
# and installed cuda 10.1 and cudnn7 in it. Thus, we don't have to 
# install it. Makes our life easy.
FROM nvidia/cuda:10.1-cudnn7-runtime-ubuntu18.04
# this is the same apt-get command that you are used to
# except the fact that, we have -y argument. Its because
# when we build this container, we cannot press Y when asked for
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
 git \
 curl \
 ca-certificates \
 python3 \
 python3-pip \
 sudo \
 && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
# We add a new user called "abhishek"
# this can be anything. Anything you want it
# to be. Usually, we don't use our own name,
# you can use "user" or "ubuntu"
RUN useradd -m abhishek
# make our user own its own home directory
RUN chown -R abhishek:abhishek /home/abhishek/
# copy all files from this direrctory to a 
# directory called app inside the home of abhishek
# and abhishek owns it.
COPY --chown=abhishek *.* /home/abhishek/app/
# change to user abhishek
USER abhishek
RUN mkdir /home/abhishek/data/
# Now we install all the requirements
# after moving to the app directory
# PLEASE NOTE that ubuntu 18.04 image
# has python 3.6.9 and not python 3.7.6
# you can also install conda python here and use that
# however, to simplify it, I will be using python 3.6.9
# inside the docker container!!!!
RUN cd /home/abhishek/app/ && pip3 install -r requirements.txt
# install mkl. its needed for transformers
RUN pip3 install mkl
# when we log into the docker container,
# we will go inside this directory automatically
